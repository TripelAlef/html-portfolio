<h1>About Me</h1>
Hello everyone!<br/>
<p> 
  My name is Or Avichzer Elmalih, I'm 25 years old and I live with my husbend in Tel-Aviv.<br/> 
  I am currently on my second year of a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Afeka â€” The Academic College of Engineering in Tel-Aviv.<br/>
  This website helps me show you, and remind myself too, about all the projects I built during the programing learning process.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  I've decided to name the website "Triple Aleph" because in Hebrew my name consists of three names that all begin with the Hebrew letter Aleph.
  But Aleph means even more to me for several reasons:<br/>
  The names of my parents and my sisters also begin with the letter Aleph, so we were always called "The Aleph Family" and on the wooden house my father built for us was written: "The house of Aleph.Aleph.Aleph".
</p>

<p> 
  Another reason (for nerds like me) is that in mathematics, particularly in set theory, the Aleph is a sign of the the cardinality of the continuum (the "size" of the set of real numbers).
  In other words, the letter Aleph represents the size of an infinite group.
</p>

<p>
  Another reason for the uniqueness of the letter Aleph for me is that Aleph is the first letter in the Hebrew language. From a short research I've done I discovered that it is believed that the letter Aleph came from the word "aloof", which means champion in Hebrew.
  Therefore, you can understand why the letter Aleph represents: family, success, power, unity, infinite love and strength for me!
</p>

<p>
  In addition, everyone who knows me knows about my unique connection with my 2 sisters - Ofir and Osher.
  Although we are not the same age, we act like a trio! We are best friends and do everything together!
</p> 

<p>
  Therefore, the combination "Triple Aleph" describes me and my beliefs in the best way and that is why I chose it.
  So we can say you've learned a lot about who am I - family person, like sentimentality and also that I like to talk alot ;D
  I told you you'll get to know me! :]
