<h1>The Best Movies According to Tripel Alef</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<p><h3>Saw</h3>
<h4>Horror Film</h4>
Ghore alart! <br />
This is my favourite horror series films!<br />
I'll recomend you to start with the first movie which is one of the best in the series, and than keep on watching all the other films in order.<br />
Even though I started with the 7th movie (and I enjoyed it as well), I still think it's more intresting to know all the details from the beginning till the end.<br />

<p><h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<h4>Fantasy Adventure Comedy Film</h4>
Love alart! <br />
One of my favourite childhood films!
Totally in love with the main character (The prince) and suprisingly after I saw "Saw 1" I discover that he also played a main character there! <br />
It is funny, unique, romantice but not cheesy movie that make you feel all the rainbow of emotions! <br />
It is one of a kind movie and even though it was published at 1987, it never gets old! <br />
</p>

<p><h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<h4>Neo-noir Psychological Thriller Film</h4>
Mind blown alart!<br />
Defenetly intresting, Psychological and mind blown film!
It's one of my favourite films ever!<br />
I don't want to tell you anything more so I don't spoil important things so I'll just say:<br />
YOU MUST SEE IT!</p>
