    <h2>What do we expect to see here? </h2>
    <p>
        In this website I present all the projects I created in the process of learning programming, from its beginning until today.<br/>
        I hope you'll enjoy and learn about my abilities, but more importantly, I hope you'll learn about who I really am!<br/>
        I would greatly appreciate it if you'll write me a review of the site - for preservation and for improvement! <br/>
        It's my way to grow and succeed. Other people's perspectives can teach us much more than we think - and I look forward to hearing yours! <br/> 
        In addition, through your reviews I can learn a little bit about you too. Which is always nice!<br/> 
        So enjoy your time here!<br/>
        Many thanks to whoever wrote me a review and nice to meet you ;].<br/>
